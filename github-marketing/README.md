# Github Marketing
This project allows you to retrieve and store information about the stargazers for a specified GitHub repository. The script fetches basic user information (login, URL, HTML URL) for each stargazer, then obtains additional profile details (name, email, bio, etc.). Then you can use this data to analyze the community, engage with users, or run marketing campaigns.

## Usage
- Marketing and outreach campaigns
- Technical talent discovery
- Developer community analysis
- Community engagement metrics
