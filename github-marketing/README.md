# Github Marketing

Programmers are often obsessed with building cool things. However, when youâ€™re working on an excellent open-source (OSS) project, you may need a marketing boost. How do you find potential users and help your project grow? This tool might help you identify your target audience. 

## Introduction
This project enables retrieving and storing information about stargazers for a specified GitHub repository. The script fetches essential user details (login, URL, HTML URL) for each stargazer on a Github repo, then obtains additional profile data (name, email, bio, etc.). You can leverage this data to analyze the community, identify potential users interested in your project, and initiate effective outreach.

## Usage
- Marketing and outreach campaigns
- Technical talent discovery
- Developer community analysis
- Community engagement metrics


## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository

## Ethical Guidelines
Please do not send unsolicited messages or spam users, and respect their privacy at all times. This tool is intended to help identify potential users who might be interested in your project, rather than annoy them. Use the data responsibly, and follow the GitHub API usage guidelines.
